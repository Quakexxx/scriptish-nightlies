Scriptish Nightly Builds
---

This repository hosts [Scriptish](http://scriptish.org/) nightly builds.

"Nightly" builds are generated automatically from the latest development source code once every night.
Hence such builds are absolutely bleeding-edge and may contain serious bugs.

Nightly builds are not meant for regular users, but for those brave testers wanting to help with the development of Scriptish.

We may later tag the individual nightlies in this repository.  This is a todo, however.
